                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Brandon Osterhout. I am a aspiring software developer who is trying to get their
                    foot into the door. I was introduced to coding through robotics programming, but I don't limit myself to any particular area. 
                    I'm interested in and practice web development, video game creation, and application development in my spare time.
                    My programming and web knowledge includes Python, JAVA, C/C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and some LUA.
                </p>

                <h1>A Brief Bio</h1>
                <p>
                    I was born in upstate New York, was raised for a short stint of time in South Carolina, and then moved back to
                     Endicott, NY. In middle school my interest in coding was sparked when I joined the FIRST Lego Robotics League.
                     When no one stepped up to the plate to do the programming of our robot, I decided to give it a try. Little did
                     I know this would lead to a life long interest. This followed into Highschool when I joined Tigertronics, team 2053 
                     in the FIRST Robotics Challenge. This is where my passion for programming started to really blossom and I started to learn my first real language,
                     C++. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After graduating High School I attended Rochester Institute of Technology for 3 years in pursuit 
                     of a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I did not graduate, but instead moved back home to re-evaluate the
                     choices I made in college. In the mean time I've been taking courses at the local community college and working
                     part time at a restaurant. That brings us to the future. I plan on either finishing my degree at another University
                     or finding employment in the software industry, whichever happens first.
